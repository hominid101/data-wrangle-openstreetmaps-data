This project is about wrangling the Mapzen metro-exracts of
OpenStreetMap data for the Kolkata metro-area in India [1]. Data
from a different geographical region contains a lot of
discrepancies with how such data is collected and described in the
US. Therefore it is expected to be an interesting and challenging
data wrangling exercise.

 Metro Extracts, City-sized portions of OpenStreetMap, served weekly.
