<title>Data Wrangling with MongoDB: OpenStreetMap in Kolkata, India</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h3 class="author">Author: Samit Chaudhuri</h3>
  <h1 class="nocount">Overview</h1>
  <p>
	This project is about wrangling the Mapzen metro-exracts of
	OpenStreetMap data for the Kolkata metro-area in India [1]. Data
	from a different geographical region contains a lot of
	discrepancies with how such data is collected and described in the
	US. Therefore it is expected to be an interesting and challenging
	data wrangling exercise.
  </p>
  <p><strong>
	  Code used in this report are included in the attached file "openstreet_kolkat.py".
  </strong></p>

  <h1>Problems Encountered in the Map Data</h1>
  <p>
	After loading the map data for Kolkata, India I first ran some
	audit code (e.g. functions audit_user_names(), audit_street_types()
	and audit_city_names() in openstreet.py) to list the user names,
	city names, and street names to assess the general goodness of
	data. The results with of the audit is presented along with the
	cleaning plan later in this section. 
  </p>
  <p>
	A cleaned up version of the map data should improve the five
	formal measurues of data quality including validity, accuracy,
	completeness, consistency, uniformity. 
  </p>
  <p>
	To improve the first of the five formal measures of data quality,
	<em>validity</em>, I would have prefered to start with a standard
	schema for Indial postal addresses. Unfortunately as discussed in
	[2], address format in India isn't very standardized. While US
	addresses contain a standard street/city/state format, Indian
	addresses often contain locality/town/city format, which makes it
	hard to fit into the fields offered in the osm format.
  </p>
  <p>
	Auditing and deciding on the cleaning plan took serveral
	iterations between them. These iterations were performed outside
	before entering the data elements into MongoDB. It was faster to
	uncompress the .bz2 file once onto the disk, and then to
	repeatedly audit the data as they came out of the SAX parser.
  </p>


  <h3>Auditing and cleaning up contibuting user information</h3>
  <p>
	<ul>
      <li> A few users have contributed most of the data.</li>
      <li> Some user names TA few users have contributed most of the data.</li>
	</ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Auditing and cleaning up local street types and names</h3>

  <p>
	The audit_street_types() function helped locate the following
	anomalies in the street names.
	<ul>
      <li>Street types are not described in a consistent manner; for
       example Rd., Rd, road, Road.</li>

      <li>Some street types contain typing errors; for example, raod
       instead of road.</li>

      <li>Some street names contain house number information; for example
       "24/j, shyamsundar pally". These items can be made
       more accurate by removing the house numbers and storing them
       in the addr:housenumber field.</li>

	  <li>Some of the street types are local to the area, such as
	  "Sarani", "Pally", and "Potti".</li>

	  <li>One street names contains an entire address
	  "Plot No. X1-1, Block EP, Sector V, Saltlake, Kolkata - 700091".
	  </li>

      <li>Some street names contain multiple street names; for example
       "41, Jawaharlal Nehru Road, Middleton Row, Middleton St".</li>

      <li>Some of the street names contain locality and town information;
      for example "Major Arterial Rd, Action Area IID, New Town".</li>
	</ul>
  </p>
  <p>
	The fix_street_name() function addresses the
	first 4 categories of issues. The remaining categories are related
	to accuracy, and need some gold standard data which are not
	available in this project.
  </p>

  <h3> Auditing and cleaning up city names</h3>
  <p>
	The audit_city_names() function helped identify following problems
	with the city names:
	<ul>
      <li> Some city names are written differently in two different
      items; for example 'Salt Lake (Bidhan Nagar)', and 'Saltlake
      (Bidhannagar)'. For better data consistency, they should both be
      written in the same way, e.g. Salt Lake (Bidhannagar) </li>

      <li> Some city names are written with different capitalizations;
      for example 'kolkata', and 'Kolkata'. For better data consistency,
      they should both be written in the same way; e.g. Kolkata.
	  </li>
	</ul>
  </p>
  <p>
	The fix_city_name() function cleans up the data and improves its
	accuracy by making the corrections mentioned above. 
  </p>

  <h3> Auditing and cleaning up postal codes</h3>
  <p>
	Addresses in India use 6-digit postal codes. The data items use 41
	unique 6-digit postal codes. The audit_postcodes() function helped
	identify following problems with the postal codes:
	<ul>
	  <li> 
		There are two 4-digit postal codes 7000, and 7400. This can be
		an issue of data validity (is it a valid postal code in Kolkata,
		India ?), or data accuracy (does this postal code exist at all
		?) issue. Google search reveals that the 7400 postal
		code is a correct postal code in neighboring country
		Bangladesh, and indeed the particular address is for a
		location in Bangladesh. 
	  </li>
	</ul>
  </p>

  <p>Some of the problems encountered during data audit are cleaned
  programmatically.
  </p>
  
  <h1>Overview of the Data</h1>
  
  <p> A statistical overview about the data set is given below. 
	<ul>
      <li> Size of the file </li>
	  <ul>
	  <li> kolkata_india.osm ... .... 106 MB </li>
	  <li> kolkata_india.osm.json ... 155 MB </li>
	  </ul>
      <li> Number of unique users 
		<pre><code>uniq_user_count = len(db.maps.distinct("created.user"))
print "There are {} of unique contrbuting users in Kolkata, India.".format(uniq_user_count)

There are 227 of unique contrbuting users in Kolkata, India.</code></pre>
	  </li>

      <li> Number of nodes and ways 
		<pre><code>node_count = db.maps.find({"type" : "node"}).count()
ways_count = db.maps.find({"type" : "way"}).count()
print "There are {} nodes and {} ways in Kolkata, India.".format(node_count, ways_count)

There are 506727 nodes and 59642 ways in Kolkata, India.</code></pre>
	  </li>

      <li> Number of chosen type of nodes, like cafes, shops etc.
		<pre><code>cafe_count = db.maps.find({"amenity" : "cafe"}).count()
restaurant_count = db.maps.find({"amenity" : "restaurant"}).count()
shop_count = db.maps.find({"amenity" : "shop"}).count()
hospital_count = db.maps.find({"amenity" : "hospital"}).count()
school_count = db.maps.find({"amenity" : "school"}).count()
college_count = db.maps.find({"amenity" : "college"}).count()
univ_count = db.maps.find({"amenity" : "university"}).count()

print """Amenities:
    cafes: {}
    restaurants: {}
    shops: {}
    hospitals: {}
    schools: {}
    colleges: {}
    universities: {}
""".format(cafe_count, restaurant_count, shop_count, hospital_count, school_count, college_count, univ_count)

Amenities:
        cafes: 9
        restaurants: 38
        shops: 0
        hospitals: 75
        schools: 135
        colleges: 65
        universities: 25</code></pre>
		</li>
	</ul>
  </p>

  <h1>Other ideas about the datasets</h1>
  <p>
	Quality analysis of the openstreet data can be a rich topic. Some of
	the interesting concerns about such data are 

	<ul>
	  <li> Is the data spatially accurate ?
	  <li> Is it always legal to use such data ? </li>
	  <li> Can this data violate national security ? </li>
	  <li> Given the level of accuracy, are the risks acceptable for a
		certain application. </li>
	</ul>
  </p>
  <p>
	One way to improve the accuracy of the data would be to establish a
	list of "ratings" for each data item, where other reviewers can rate
	the accuracy of each entry. This would make it possible to establish
	a quntifiable measure of fidelity of a data item based on number of
	reviews and their actual ratings. Applications will be able to
	filter out the data items that fall below some fidelity
	threshold. National security interests can be safeguarded by adding
	a "contributor-id" to each data item. This will allow regulatory
	agencies to perform security audit of sensitive areas and track down
	contributors that enter data that violate a nation's security
	interests.
  </p>
  <p>
	If the quality is acceptable, the OpenStreetMap data can a gold mine
	of opportunities for many applications
	<ul>
	  <li> Real time routing projects e.g. open source routing machine
		[4] </li>
	  <li> Provide spatial awareness to humanitarial projects that
		distribute goods and services to remote communities. </li>
	  <li> Analysis on spatial distribution of land and resources.</li>
	</ul>
  </p>
